Role Name
=========

This role will aid you in the installation of one or more specific CVE on your RHEL servers.

After the given CVEs are installed, it will send an email with an attached CVS file, called "report.csv", with a summary of the hosts involved in the play, the CVE installed on each, and if the host need to be rebooted or not after installing the CVE.

NOTE: when several CVEs are installed on the host, if one of those CVE requires a reboot, the "REBOOT REQUIRED" column in the report will be marked as true for all host rows, despite if the CVE requires or not a reboot.

This role has been tested with:
  - RHEL 7
  - RHEL 8
  - RHEL 9

Requirements
------------

This role depends on the "community.general" collection, used to send a report of the installed CVEs through mail.

Example Playbook
----------------

Including an example of how to use your role (dfor instance, with variables passed in as parameters) is always nice for users too:

When running from CLI:
```
ansible-playbook patch-cve.yml -e "cves='CVE-2024-5564 CVE-2024-24806'" -e "reboot=false" -e "host_to_apply=all" -e "mail_smtp_host=smtp.example.com" -e "mail_subject='CVE Patching'" -e "mail_body='Please, find the installed CVE report in the attachments.'" -e "mail_sender=sender@example.com" -e "mail_recipient=recipient@example.com"
```
This will install the CVEs "CVE-2024-5564" and "CVE-2024-24806" on all hosts, and will reboot the hosts if one of the installed CVE requires it to be effective.

The content of the "patch-cve.yml" playbook:
```
    - hosts: "{{ host_to_apply | default('localhost') }}"
      roles:
         - cve-patch-rhel
```
